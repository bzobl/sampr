/// An arbitrary type implementing the [Actor] trait will become a _sampr_ actor. Use
/// [Actor::start()] to start receiving messages for the actor. Once started, the actor
/// object will be moved to a [tokio::task](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/task/index.html).
///
/// The application should then use messages to interact with this actor. Messages can be sent
/// using this actor's [Addr]. Access to the actor while processing those messages will be granted
/// through a mutable reference in the respective handler functions and callbacks. Additionally,
/// those will have a reference to the actor's [AsyncContext] at hand to interact with the actor
/// and the actor's [tokio::task].

///   type Context = sampr::Context<Self>;
